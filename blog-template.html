      <h1>The Box Model</h1>
      <p>When was the last time you were at an art gallery or a museum? Think back to the way the art was displayed (not sculptures, the stuff on the walls). Chances are, the paintings or photographs you saw were framed, and there was some space between the artwork and the frame. Something like this: <a href="imgs/badger-framed.jpg" id="badger">badger family</a>. What you're looking at is the real world model that the structure of HTML elements is based on.</p>
      <p>We can see the content, in this case a family of badgers; around that we see what's called padding, the space between the content and the frame; and then the frame itself (a sort of border). This is almost the entire picture. If you recall our art gallery metaphor, there are multiple works hanging on the wall, so we should also take into account the space between them. Let's call that space a margin. This is all kind of a convoluted way of saying that an HTML element is composed of 4 parts: the content, padding, border, and margin. We call it "the box model." You've seen it in the real world with framed artwork. In the world of web development, we can conceptualize it like <a href="imgs/box-model.png">this</a>.</p>
      <p>Now each of these parts of and HTML element can be shaped to our liking using CSS. Why do we need so many parameters to tweak? Well, wrapping content with padding and a border allows us to frame it in a way that's familiar and visually pleasing (if you need an example of this, just check that picture of me on my homepage). It's also important to keep in mind that these parameters apply to ALL HTML elements; that means pictures, text, links, menues, pretty much anything you can see on a website. So if you want to put a border around some text, you'll want some space between so the border doesn't interfere with what you wrote. As for margins, they're super useful for fine tuning the placement of elements on your website. Lets say you posted an article to your website and the text looks just a little left of center and it's bugging you; you just tweak the size of that text block's left margin and now it's right where you want it! So there you have it: the box model; a useful way to style and place the elements in your web page. 



      <h1>Using git</h1>
      <p>
        I come from an audio engineering background and man, I wish there was some kind of version control like git for recording studios. When you’re recording/mixing a piece you have to keep track of hundreds of different tracks(drums, vocals, guitar are stored as different files until the very end) and for each of those tracks, there can be hundreds of takes. Then once you organize all of that, you make a bunch of different mixes, and try to store them all within your DAW (the music world equivalent of an IDE). Some DAWs have their own proprietary file management systems, but I’ve never seen one that implements a branching system like git. What usually ends up happening is you have a folder with a ton of session files and IF you're engineer is organized (audio engineers usually aren't), they're all just labeled "songname.date." Now god forbid you want to collaborate with someone remotely. The ability to make contributions without overwriting another persons is revelatory to me. Anyway the point I’m trying to make it that I dig git. It’s smart stuff, this version control.

        Git is a little tough to get into at first. It has its own names for functions that already had established identities. You don't "save" a file in a "folder" for your "program," you "commit" it to a "directory" for your "repository." But once you get past that kind of thing, it has a lot of really useful features. Git keeps track of every commit you make. Forever. And it stores multiple versions of a working file, which you can add to your main project at any point, and they'll magically create a cohesive whole. Did you make a mistake? Did you write a new piece of code that doesn't work with something you wrote a year ago? You can just go back to that commit from a year ago, fix the old piece of code, and test it in it's original setting, then merge that change with the most recent version of your program. At least I think that's how it works. This is all pretty speculative. I'm new to this.

        Github is the wonderful companion to git that lets you collaborate with anyone anywhere. You store your main project up in the cloud, and everyone on your dev team; you, your college bud who lives in Seattle now, and that lady you met at that conference who lives in Mumbai all get a copy of it. You all make a copy of your copy and take it down to your computers. Now you're all working on the parts of the whole and sending them up bit by bit. Github still has the magic of adding changes without overwriting others, but it also creates a platform for the team to review eachother's code and test it before adding it into the master file. There's a lot of systems in place to prevent screw ups, and even if there is one, git/github is still remembering every commit you make forever, so you can always go back to the last savepoint.

        In conclusion: git and github (and pretty much the concept of version control in general) are pretty damn nifty. I'm looking forward to learning more in the coming weeks!

      <h1>Chefs in the Kitchen</h1>
      <p>
        I have a few friends who are teachers. From the time I've spent with them, I've learned a bit about progressive educational theory. I get the sense that Dev Bootcamp is more than a little progressive. I started to realize I needed to make a career transition a couple of years ago, but I knew I couldn't go back to traditional academia. After graduating college, I felt so burnt out on school. I had put in my time and was ready for the next phase of life to begin (in case my parents read this, don't get me wrong, I still think traditional education has a tremendous amount of value and I'm very grateful for the experiences I had in that system). Becoming a programmer takes some serious learning though, so when I decided to make this transition, I had to figure out how to learn in a way that works for me.

        Shareef speaks about being co-creators in our educational experience. I'm very excited to be a part of that process. I want to be a programmer in part because the job is to explore, learn, and create. The DBC experience seems to follow the same process, which sounds like a lot of fun, and also like great preparation for my future working environment. A lot of my personal leanings are in line with the program's, so I plan on engaging wholeheartedly with engineering empathy, yoga, and mindfulness practice.

        Am I nervous? Of course. I've never taken on such a huge volume of work in such a short period of time. To be honest, I was a little overwhelmed by week one, and it only ramps up from here. I know I can learn this stuff, I just worry about my mental stamina and organizational ability. And I worry about retention. They say the best way to learn is by repetition over time, and there are some aspects of DBC that seem akin to an all night cram session before a test. I should ask someone about that.
    </p>
    <p>
       Overall, I'm feeling good about my choice to attend Dev Bootcamp. I think the culture is one I can really get into, and anyone who would choose to be a part of it is likely someone I can really get along with. So let's start the journey!
