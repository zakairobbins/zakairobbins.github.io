      <h1>Gettin' Classy in Ruby:</h1> 
      <p>
        Today we’re talking about classes. An integral part of object oriented design, classes are objects that contain other objects. Classes can hold just about any type of data you can imagine: variables, methods, data structures, even other classes. All the data contained within a class is its own; we use the word “instance” when talking about data belonging to a class. A variable floating around somewhere in the main body of your code is just called a variable, but when a variable is a part of a class, it’s called an “instance variable.” Same thing with instance methods. While data belonging to a class is largely self contained, it can be accessed by outside elements. Classes function similarly to how your body does. Your body is made of a number of self contained elements, like organs, bones, and neurons. While they’re entirely your own, they can be affected by the outside world. If your stomach (a variable in your digestive tract) is hungry, you can access some food to change its state to full. Similarly, your strength is a function of your muscle mass and it’s proportional abilities (equal to 1:1 on a human scale). But, if you were bitten by a radioactive spider, your proportional strength is now changed to 20:1 on a human scale. So let’s take a look at these two classes here: 
      </p>
      <p>
        class Monster<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;attr_reader :hit_value, :defense<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;attr_accessor :health<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;def initialize(health, hit_value, defense)<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@health = health<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@hit_value = hit_value<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@defense = defense<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;end<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;def attack(target)<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;target.health -= (@hit_value - target.defense)<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;end<br>
          
          &nbsp;&nbsp;def heal_yourself<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@health += @health + 20<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;end<br>
        end<br><br>

        class Hero<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;attr_reader :hit_value, :defense<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;attr_accessor :health<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;def initialize(health, hit_value, defense)<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@health = health<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@hit_value = hit_value<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; @defense = defense<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;end<br>
        end<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Here’s the scenario: a monster in a cave is minding its own business, doing monster stuff one day, when a hero just rolls in out of nowhere and starts looting the cave’s treasure and fighting creatures for XP. The poor monster is caught unawares; it wants no part of this, but the hero readies her shiny sword, preparing to attack. What can the monster do? Let’s take a look inside it’s class: 
      </p>
      <p>
        class Monster<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;attr_reader :hit_value, :defense<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;attr_accessor :health<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;def initialize(health, hit_value, defense)<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@health = health<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@hit_value = hit_value<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@defense = defense<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;end<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        Ok, we can see here that the monster, upon birth, was initialized with a value for it’s health, how hard it can hit things, and it’s ability to defend itself. The variables, @health, @hit_value, and @defense are instance variables, the @ sign at the start of their name denotes that. These variables can be used within the monster class to define it’s state, and what it’s methods can do. Don’t worry about that attr_reader / attr_accessor stuff, that’s a topic for a later blog post. Now about those methods: 
      </p>
      <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;def attack(target)<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;target.health -= (@hit_value - target.defense)<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;end<br>
          
          &nbsp;&nbsp;def heal_yourself<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@health += @health + 20<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;end<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        attack and heal_yourself are instance methods. They define the actions the monster can take, and they rely on it’s instance variables to define their effectiveness. The monster can attack a target, which will result in the target’s own @health instance variable decreasing in value (after their defense is factored in). As long as the object the monster uses it’s attack method on has an @health and @defense instance variable of it’s own, the monster’s attack will happen without issue. It also knows a little magic, so it can cast a healing spell on itself to increase the value of it’s own @health instance variable. With these two methods, we see that classes need instance variables to define their state, and they can use instance methods to affect themselves, and other objects (even other classes) around them. Pretty cool, right? Let’s hope the poor thing does ok against that hero, she looks like she means business…

      <h1>Coding with Friends</h1>
      <p>
        I’m a very social creature. Phase 0 at Dev Bootcamp is a mostly solitary undertaking, so I’ve come to really look forward to my paired coding sessions. Phase 0 is also a singular experience, so it’s nice to connect with people who are undergoing the same crazy, exhilarating process. I’ve only had the pleasure of pairing with a few people so far, and these sessions are my first experience coding with a partner, but I can definitely say that I’d rather pair up than code solo any day. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I think I learn more from pairing than coding solo. There’s always a lot of ways to solve a problem with code, but I tend to get very zoned in on one solution once I get going with it. Working with a pair though, I frequently gain a new perspective learn a better approach. Even more valuable than learning things like when to use a method vs. an enumerable, is gaining insight into other people’s way of thinking. Watching someone else break down a problem has shown me that there are so many different ways to be good at coding, and that being flexible with one’s thinking is crucial. When I started to consider moving into programming, I asked a few people in the field for advice, and what I heard the most was that the biggest hurdle to get over was to learn to “think like a programmer.” I thought at the time that meant learning a single formula for logic and problem solving. Now I’m learning that while it’s crucial to understand formal logic and how a computer interprets data, writing good code requires a lot more mental agility than I previously thought. 
      </p>
      <p>
        After we pair at Dev Bootcamp, we give feedback to each other on how we feel our partner did technically and culturally. The goal is to do more than just pat each other on the back; we’re supposed to highlight things that our partner excelled in and areas in which we can improve. It’s difficult for me to critique someone else, as I tend to either feel unqualified to point out someone else’s weak points, or I feel that if I tell someone where they can improve, they’ll take my advice to mean they’re failing. It’s key to move past that discomfort though, as an outside perspective can illuminate weaknesses you didn’t even know you had. 
      </p>
      <p>
        From the feedback I’ve received so far, I’ve realized that I need to work on paying attention to my syntax. I tend to get wrapped up in getting my idea down, and miss a comma or an end statement, which leads to wasted time searching back through my code when I inevitably get errors. I’m hoping it’s just a matter of practice, but with all the great people I have to pair with at DBC, I’m sure I can get past it in no time.

      <h1>The Box Model</h1>
      <p>
        When was the last time you were at an art gallery or a museum? Think back to the way the art was displayed (not sculptures, the stuff on the walls). Chances are, the paintings or photographs you saw were framed, and there was some space between the artwork and the frame. Something like this <a href="imgs/badger-framed.jpg" id="badger">badger family</a>. What you're looking at is the real world model that the structure of HTML elements is based on.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can see the content, in this case a family of badgers; around that we see what's called padding, the space between the content and the frame; and then the frame itself (a sort of border). This is almost the entire picture. If you recall our art gallery metaphor, there are multiple works hanging on the wall, so we should also take into account the space between them. Let's call that space a margin. This is all kind of a convoluted way of saying that an HTML element is composed of 4 parts: the content, padding, border, and margin. We call it "the box model." You've seen it in the real world with framed artwork. In the world of web development, we can conceptualize it like <a href="imgs/box-model.png">this</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now each of these parts of and HTML element can be shaped to our liking using CSS. Why do we need so many parameters to tweak? Well, wrapping content with padding and a border allows us to frame it in a way that's familiar and visually pleasing (if you need an example of this, just check that picture of me on my homepage). It's also important to keep in mind that these parameters apply to ALL HTML elements; that means pictures, text, links, menues, pretty much anything you can see on a website. So if you want to put a border around some text, you'll want some space between so the border doesn't interfere with what you wrote. As for margins, they're super useful for fine tuning the placement of elements on your website. Lets say you posted an article to your website and the text looks just a little left of center and it's bugging you; you just tweak the size of that text block's left margin and now it's right where you want it! So there you have it: the box model; a useful way to style and place the elements in your web page.

      <h1>Using git</h1>
      <p>
        I come from an audio engineering background and man, I wish there was some kind of version control like git for recording studios. When you’re recording/mixing a piece you have to keep track of hundreds of different tracks(drums, vocals, guitar are stored as different files until the very end) and for each of those tracks, there can be hundreds of takes. Then once you organize all of that, you make a bunch of different mixes, and try to store them all within your DAW (the music world equivalent of an IDE). Some DAWs have their own proprietary file management systems, but I’ve never seen one that implements a branching system like git. What usually ends up happening is you have a folder with a ton of session files and IF you're engineer is organized (audio engineers usually aren't), they're all just labeled "songname.date." Now god forbid you want to collaborate with someone remotely. The ability to make contributions without overwriting another persons is revelatory to me. Anyway the point I’m trying to make it that I dig git. It’s smart stuff, this version control.

      </p>
      <p>
        Git is a little tough to get into at first. It has its own names for functions that already had established identities. You don't "save" a file in a "folder" for your "program," you "commit" it to a "directory" for your "repository." But once you get past that kind of thing, it has a lot of really useful features. Git keeps track of every commit you make. Forever. And it stores multiple versions of a working file, which you can add to your main project at any point, and they'll magically create a cohesive whole. Did you make a mistake? Did you write a new piece of code that doesn't work with something you wrote a year ago? You can just go back to that commit from a year ago, fix the old piece of code, and test it in it's original setting, then merge that change with the most recent version of your program. At least I think that's how it works. This is all pretty speculative. I'm new to this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Github is the wonderful companion to git that lets you collaborate with anyone anywhere. You store your main project up in the cloud, and everyone on your dev team; you, your college bud who lives in Seattle now, and that lady you met at that conference who lives in Mumbai all get a copy of it. You all make a copy of your copy and take it down to your computers. Now you're all working on the parts of the whole and sending them up bit by bit. Github still has the magic of adding changes without overwriting others, but it also creates a platform for the team to review eachother's code and test it before adding it into the master file. There's a lot of systems in place to prevent screw ups, and even if there is one, git/github is still remembering every commit you make forever, so you can always go back to the last savepoint.
      </p>
      <p>
        In conclusion: git and github (and pretty much the concept of version control in general) are pretty damn nifty. I'm looking forward to learning more in the coming weeks!

      <h1>Chefs in the Kitchen</h1>
      <p>
        I have a few friends who are teachers. From the time I've spent with them, I've learned a bit about progressive educational theory. I get the sense that Dev Bootcamp is more than a little progressive. I started to realize I needed to make a career transition a couple of years ago, but I knew I couldn't go back to traditional academia. After graduating college, I felt so burnt out on school. I had put in my time and was ready for the next phase of life to begin (in case my parents read this, don't get me wrong, I still think traditional education has a tremendous amount of value and I'm very grateful for the experiences I had in that system). Becoming a programmer takes some serious learning though, so when I decided to make this transition, I had to figure out how to learn in a way that works for me.

        Shareef speaks about being co-creators in our educational experience. I'm very excited to be a part of that process. I want to be a programmer in part because the job is to explore, learn, and create. The DBC experience seems to follow the same process, which sounds like a lot of fun, and also like great preparation for my future working environment. A lot of my personal leanings are in line with the program's, so I plan on engaging wholeheartedly with engineering empathy, yoga, and mindfulness practice.
    </p>

    <p>
        Am I nervous? Of course. I've never taken on such a huge volume of work in such a short period of time. To be honest, I was a little overwhelmed by week one, and it only ramps up from here. I know I can learn this stuff, I just worry about my mental stamina and organizational ability. And I worry about retention. They say the best way to learn is by repetition over time, and there are some aspects of DBC that seem akin to an all night cram session before a test. I should ask someone about that.
    </p>
    <p>
       Overall, I'm feeling good about my choice to attend Dev Bootcamp. I think the culture is one I can really get into, and anyone who would choose to be a part of it is likely someone I can really get along with. So let's start the journey!
