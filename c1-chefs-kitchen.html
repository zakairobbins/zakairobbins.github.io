      I have a few friends who are teachers. From the time I've spent with them, I've learned a bit about progressive educational theory. I get the sense that Dev Bootcamp is more than a little progressive. I started to realize I needed to make a career transition a couple of years ago, but I knew I couldn't go back to traditional academia. After graduating college, I felt so burnt out on school. I had put in my time and was ready for the next phase of life to begin (in case my parents read this, don't get me wrong, I still think traditional education has a tremendous amount of value and I'm very grateful for the experiences I had in that system). Becoming a programmer takes some serious learning though, so when I decided to make this transition, I had to figure out how to learn in a way that works for me.

      Shareef speaks about being co-creators in our educational experience. I'm very excited to be a part of that process. I want to be a programmer in part because the job is to explore, learn, and create. The DBC experience seems to follow the same process, which sounds like a lot of fun, and also like great preparation for my future working environment. A lot of my personal leanings are in line with the program's, so I plan on engaging wholeheartedly with engineering empathy, yoga, and mindfulness practice.

        Am I nervous? Of course. I've never taken on such a huge volume of work in such a short period of time. To be honest, I was a little overwhelmed by week one, and it only ramps up from here. I know I can learn this stuff, I just worry about my mental stamina and organizational ability. And I worry about retention. They say the best way to learn is by repetition over time, and there are some aspects of DBC that seem akin to an all night cram session before a test. I should ask someone about that.

       Overall, I'm feeling good about my choice to attend Dev Bootcamp. I think the culture is one I can really get into, and anyone who would choose to be a part of it is likely someone I can really get along with. So let's start the journey!
