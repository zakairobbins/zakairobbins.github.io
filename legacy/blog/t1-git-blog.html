I come from an audio engineering background and man, I wish there was some kind of version control like git for recording studios. When you’re recording/mixing a piece you have to keep track of hundreds of different tracks(drums, vocals, guitar are stored as different files until the very end) and for each of those tracks, there can be hundreds of takes. Then once you organize all of that, you make a bunch of different mixes, and try to store them all within your DAW (the music world equivalent of an IDE). Some DAWs have their own proprietary file management systems, but I’ve never seen one that implements a branching system like git. What usually ends up happening is you have a folder with a ton of session files and IF you're engineer is organized (audio engineers usually aren't), they're all just labeled "songname.date." Now god forbid you want to collaborate with someone remotely. The ability to make contributions without overwriting another persons is revelatory to me. Anyway the point I’m trying to make it that I dig git. It’s smart stuff, this version control.

        Git is a little tough to get into at first. It has its own names for functions that already had established identities. You don't "save" a file in a "folder" for your "program," you "commit" it to a "directory" for your "repository." But once you get past that kind of thing, it has a lot of really useful features. Git keeps track of every commit you make. Forever. And it stores multiple versions of a working file, which you can add to your main project at any point, and they'll magically create a cohesive whole. Did you make a mistake? Did you write a new piece of code that doesn't work with something you wrote a year ago? You can just go back to that commit from a year ago, fix the old piece of code, and test it in it's original setting, then merge that change with the most recent version of your program. At least I think that's how it works. This is all pretty speculative. I'm new to this.

      Github is the wonderful companion to git that lets you collaborate with anyone anywhere. You store your main project up in the cloud, and everyone on your dev team; you, your college bud who lives in Seattle now, and that lady you met at that conference who lives in Mumbai all get a copy of it. You all make a copy of your copy and take it down to your computers. Now you're all working on the parts of the whole and sending them up bit by bit. Github still has the magic of adding changes without overwriting others, but it also creates a platform for the team to review eachother's code and test it before adding it into the master file. There's a lot of systems in place to prevent screw ups, and even if there is one, git/github is still remembering every commit you make forever, so you can always go back to the last savepoint.

      In conclusion: git and github (and pretty much the concept of version control in general) are pretty damn nifty. I'm looking forward to learning more in the coming weeks!
